# Bay Wheels Planner

Bay Wheels Planner is an app to find the flattest routes and avoid the hilliest routes while using the [Bay Wheels](https://www.lyft.com/bikes/bay-wheels) bike share system.

While building Bay Wheels Planner, I've done a bunch of research and found there are similar attempts by other developers:

- [Steepless](https://github.com/cheeaun/steepless)
- [Bikesy](http://bikesy.com/)
- [Hill Mapper](http://hillmapper.com/)
- [The Steeps Of San Francisco](http://www.datapointed.net/2009/11/the-steeps-of-san-francisco/) and its [sequel](http://www.datapointed.net/2010/02/more-steeps-of-san-francisco/)
- [Flattest Route](http://www.flattestroute.com/)
- [Hillmap](http://www.hillmap.com/)
